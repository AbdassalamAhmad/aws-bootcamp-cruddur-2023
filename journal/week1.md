# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

### Running Flask App Locally
I've tried running it locally and it didn't work.
I'm using windows machine and couldn't do the `export FRONTEND_URL="*" && export BACKEND_URL="*"` commands.<br> 
I've tried using `setx` command and succeded in doing the env vars part.

But still wasn't able to run it and got this error.

So, I **skipped the local part and head to the dockerization part**.

## Running Cruddur Front-End & Back-End using Docker
### Back-End Docker part

- Created [backend-flask/Dockerfile]() locally and built an image using the next command<br>
- `docker build -t backend-flask ./backend-flask`
- Run the image using this command `docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it -e FRONTEND_URL='*' -e BACKEND_URL='*' backend-flask`
