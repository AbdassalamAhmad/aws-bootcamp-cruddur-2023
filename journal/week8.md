# Week 8 â€” Serverless Image Processing

**NOTE**: The whole week is about getting image from s3 bucket (avatar image) and proccess it using an image library,
the process is done using lambda function written in JS to sharpen or enhance the image and,
store the processed image again in the s3 bucket in different folder.

## Install CDK Globally

- This is so we can use the AWS CDK CLI from anywhere.
`npm install aws-cdk -g`
- Add that command in `.gitpod.yml`
- Initialize a new project -> this command will output a folder that has lots of files to give us a good starting point.
`cdk init app --language typescript`

### Important Commands

- Bootstrapping
> Deploying stacks with the AWS CDK requires dedicated Amazon S3 buckets and other containers to be available to AWS CloudFormation during deployment. 
```sh
cdk bootstrap "aws://$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID/$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION"
```

- Build
> We can use build to catch errors prematurely.
(This command will generate JS code and then output errors in the terminal)
```sh
npm run build
```

- Synth
> the synth command is used to synthesize the AWS CloudFormation stack(s) that represent your infrastructure as code.
(like giving yaml cloudformataion template of what your cdk code will make.)
```sh
cdk synth
```

- Deploy
> will deploy those resources
```sh
cdk deploy
```

- List Stacks
```sh
cdk ls
```

## Add S3 Bucket && Lambda Function

- Installed `dotenv` lib and import it in this file `thumbing-serverless-cdk-stack.ts`. using this command
`npm i dotenv`
```typescript
    // reference env files
    const bucketName: string = process.env.THUMBING_BUCKET_NAME as string;
    const functionPath: string = process.env.THUMBING_FUNCTION_PATH as string;
    const folderInput: string = process.env.THUMBING_S3_FOLDER_INPUT as string;
    const folderOutput: string = process.env.THUMBING_S3_FOLDER_OUTPUT as string;
    // The code that defines your stack goes here
    const bucket = this.createBucket(bucketName);
    const lambda = this.createLambda(functionPath, bucketName, folderInput, folderOutput);

  }

  createBucket(bucketName: string): s3.IBucket{
    const bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'ThumbingBucket', {
      bucketName: bucketName,
      removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
    });
    return bucket;
  }

  createLambda(functionPath: string, bucketName: string, folderInput: string, folderOutput: string): lambda.IFunction {
    const lambdaFunction = new lambda.Function(this, 'ThumbLambda', {
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
      handler: 'index.handler',
      code: lambda.Code.fromAsset(functionPath),
      environment: {
        DEST_BUCKET_NAME: bucketName,
        FOLDER_INPUT: folderInput,
        FOLDER_OUTPUT: folderOutput,
        PROCESS_WIDTH: '512',
        PROCESS_HEIGHT: '512'
      }
    });
    return lambdaFunction;
  } 
```
- **Note:** meaning of the handler property is set to 'index.handler',
 which means that the entry point for the Lambda function is the handler function within the index.js file,
 located in the path/to/my/function/code directory.

- Add `.env` file
```yml
THUMBING_BUCKET_NAME="aa-cruddur-avatar-thumbs"
THUMBING_FUNCTION_PATH="/workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/aws/lambdas"
THUMBING_S3_FOLDER_INPUT="/avatar/original"
THUMBING_S3_FOLDER_OUTPUT= "/avatar/processed"
```

## Implement Serverless Pipeline (2nd video)
### summury
- We want to create a lambda function that will be triggered once we upload a picture (avatar) to our front-end (now to S3 bucket).
- The Lambda function will proccess the image and resize it and store in the same bucket in different folder.
- Once the new picture added an sns topic will be triggered.


### Add Lambda code in JS
- Used JS to write Lmabda code because we will use `sharp` library to process images because it is light-weight library unlike other languages libraries.
- Installed `sharp` and `@aws-sdk/client-s3` using `npm i` command after `npm init -y`
- The main magic is happening in `index.js` where we get the name of the picture with its path, then we conver the name with the path to the new location.
- We do the process using `sharp` library from the code written in `s3-image-processing.js` file.
- Finally we do the upload (put), we get the processed image from this function `processImage` then we upload it to s3 in the new location using this function `uploadProcessedImage`.
- `test.js` to test the process library without lambda (locally).
- `example.json` to test the lambda S3.put to check permessions and see the logs.

- Why used decoder and /+ in `const srcKey = decodeURIComponent(event.Records[0].s3.object.key.replace(/\+/g, ' '));`
The reason for using the decode function is that if space in the key it will be as `%20` without using decode
if i use decode it will be sent as a space.

### Add scripts for s3 assets bucket 
- made some scripts to make uploads and clear S3 bucket and building the dependencies required for lambda easier for us while developing.

### Ignore node_modules & Install sharp and cdk in gitpod & Update envs
- did all of that.
- export my DOMAIN_NAME & gp env DOMAIN_NAME.
- add 2 more env and edit the previous ones.
- remove `/` from the THUMBING_S3_FOLDER_INPUT & output.
- change the name of the bucket to be assets.domainname because CloudFormation require that in future.

### Update Stack
- Do the import, reference the new env.
- Import our manual created S3 bucket.
- Add S3 Event Notification to lambda and SNS.
- Create SNS Topic and Subscription.
- Create policies for access and put objects in S3 from lambda.
- Attach those policies to lambda.
- Comment some code for SNS Policy.
